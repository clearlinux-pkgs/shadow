This affected only OpenSuSE.  The affected code never made its way to
upstream and Clear Linux never picked the unapproved pull request.

Upstream never had the 755 in it's code.  It was part of the original patch
proposed in https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/2 It was still in
review for upstream, but already used by us.

Upstream maintainer already at this point, when reviewing the code, hinted
to the 777 -> 755 change.

This PR then got forgotten it seems.  And later when I updated our patch,
which didn't build anymore due to the prefix change in the code, I also
looked at the review of pull/2 and thought it makes sense.  I created
https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/112 which got merged as
b3b6d9d77c1d18b98670b97157777bb74092cd69.

So like I tried to state above: This was only a problem for us.  Upstream
never had this 777 "issue" in its code :-)
